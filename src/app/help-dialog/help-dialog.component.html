  <h2>Selection</h2>
  Individual elements (nodes or edges) can be selected by clicking on them.
  Shift-clicking or control-clicking will add or remove nodes to the current
  selection. Shift-click-dragging or control-click-dragging will add all
  elements in a region to the selection.

  <h2>Hiding elements</h2>
  Right-clicking on an element presents options for hiding a specific element or
  entire classes of elements. Hidden elements can be re-shown by cancelling
  chips in the "Transformations" panel.

  <h2>Collapsing compound nodes</h2>
  Right-clicking on a compound node presents options for collapsing classes of
  nodes. Clicking on a compound node shows an icon on that node for collapsing
  or expanding that individual node.

  <h2>Edit mode</h2>
  To enable edit mode, click on the toggle in the "Graph definition" panel.
